**Capitalizr** - Its a utility which lets you capitalize *(upcase the first
letter of the words, also called capitalcase)* words in a file, leaving the
words which have 3 or less characters. The file may look pretty if it has all
words in capitalcase in it. I was inspired to create this file/project when
I was listening to music. Everytime I listen to any new song I try to write
its lyrics on my own. Just slowing down the playing speed of song didn't help
that much, I was suppose to loop the song over a specific time and listen what
is being sung, and in hurry I wrote whole the script in lowercase. So one day
it came in my mind, why not use Python for this?

##Requirements:##
 * Unix/Linux
 * Python

You will probably have Python installed if you are using Unix.

##How to Install:##
Refer to [INSTALL](https://github.com/sntshkmr60/capitalizr/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
file for more instruction related to installation.


##How to Use:##
After installing, you should be able to type `capitalizr` in terminal.
Type capitalizr followed by the filename and the output will be on
the screen. E.g. `capitalizr inputfile.txt`

##Tricks:##
You can write the output into file by doing appending `> outputfile.txt`.
Like this: `capitalizr inputfile.txt > outputfile.txt`. And the output will
be on a file named outputfile.txt
