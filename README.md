**capitalizr** - It's a utility that lets you change the case *(lowercase to
uppercase the letter of the words)* words in a file, leaving the words which
have 3 or less letters. The file looks pretty if it has all words in
capitalcase in it.

##Requirements:##
 * Unix/Linux
 * Python

You will probably have Python installed if you are using UNIX :)

##How to Install:##
Refer to [INSTALL][1] file for more instruction related to installation.


##How to Use:##
###Basic###
After following the instructions in [INSTALL][1] file, you should be able
to type `capitalizr` in terminal. Type capitalizr followed by the filename
and the output will be on the screen. E.g. `capitalizr inputfile.txt`

###Saving Output###
You can write the output into file by doing appending `> outputfile.txt`.
Like this: `capitalizr inputfile.txt > outputfile.txt`. And the output will
be on a file named outputfile.txt

###Piping###
capitalizr also supports UNIX piping. So you can do
`cat inputfile.txt | capitalizr -` and it will work.
