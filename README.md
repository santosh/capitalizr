**capitalizr** - It's a utility that lets you change the case *(lowercase to
uppercase the letter of the words)* words in a file, leaving the words which
have 3 or less letters. The file looks pretty if it has all words in
capitalcase in it.

##why not sed?##
 * Because capitalizr is easy to use
 * sed doesn't takes input from stdin, it just works on piping.

##How to Install:##
The one and only requirement is Python, if you are on any variant of UNIX 
(e.g. Linux, \*BSD, Mac etc) then you have a good luck, else [download][4] it.
The simplest installation (for UNIX) is [download][3]/clone the archive, extract
it `cd` to it and run the setup:

    $ python setup.py install

Refer to [INSTALL][1] file for more instruction related to installation.

##Usages##
After following the instructions in [INSTALL][1] file, you should be able
to type `capitalizr` in terminal. Type capitalizr followed by the filename
and the output will be on the screen:

    $ capitalizr inputfile.txt


Pipe input to it

    $ cat inputfile.txt | capitalizr -

Input from **stdin**

    $ capitalizr
    the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
    ^D
    the Quick Brown fox Jumps Over the Lazy dog

You can write the output into file by passing `-o` followed by output filename

    $ capitalizr inputfile.txt -o outputfile.txt

And the output will be on a file named outputfile.txt
