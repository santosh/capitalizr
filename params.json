{"name":"capitalizr","tagline":"A command line program to capitalize/upcase words in a file. First letter of any words are capitalized.","body":"**capitalizr** - It's a utility that lets you change the case *(lowercase to\r\nuppercase the letter of the words)* words in a file, leaving the words which\r\nhave 3 or less letters. The file looks pretty if it has all words in\r\ncapitalcase in it.\r\n\r\n##Requirements:##\r\n * Unix/Linux\r\n * Python\r\n\r\nYou will probably have Python installed if you are using UNIX :)\r\n\r\n##How to Install:##\r\nRefer to [INSTALL][1] file for more instruction related to installation.\r\n\r\n\r\n##How to Use:##\r\n###Basic###\r\nAfter following the instructions in [INSTALL][1] file, you should be able\r\nto type `capitalizr` in terminal. Type capitalizr followed by the filename\r\nand the output will be on the screen. E.g. `capitalizr inputfile.txt`\r\n\r\n###Saving Output###\r\nYou can write the output into file by doing appending `> outputfile.txt`.\r\nLike this: `capitalizr inputfile.txt > outputfile.txt`. And the output will\r\nbe on a file named outputfile.txt\r\n\r\n###Piping###\r\ncapitalizr also supports UNIX piping. So you can do\r\n`cat inputfile.txt | capitalizr -` and it will work.\r\n\r\n##To do:##\r\nThese might seem silly ;) Here are implementation I want, priority wise:\r\n\r\n * Manual page (And the installation of it)\r\n * Put it in repository list of Ubuntu, Fedora etc.\r\n * Deployment with Debian package and Windows installer.\r\n * Implement GUI\r\n * Android App\r\n * Internationalization\r\n\r\nSee also the `sandbox` branch of the repository.\r\n\r\n##Contributors:##\r\n\r\n * [santosh][2]\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/santosh/capitalizr/blob/master/INSTALL.md\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/santosh\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
