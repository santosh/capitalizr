**capitalizr** - It's a utility that lets you change the case *(lowercase to
uppercase the letter of the words)* words in a file, leaving the words which
have 3 or less letters. The file looks pretty if it has all words in
capitalcase in it.

why not sed?
------------

- because capitalizr is easy to use, just damn simple
- sed doesn't takes input from stdin, it just works on piping.

Install
-------

The one and only requirement is Python, if you are on any variant of UNIX 
*(e.g. Linux, *BSD, Mac etc)* then you have a good luck, else `download <http://www.python.org/download/>`__ it.
The simplest installation (for UNIX) is `download <https://github.com/santosh/capitalizr/archive/master.zip>`__/clone the archive, extract
it ``cd`` to it and run the setup::

    $ python setup.py install

Refer to `INSTALL`_ file for more instruction related to installation.

Usages
------

After following the instructions in `INSTALL`_ file, you should be able
to type ``capitalizr`` in terminal. Type capitalizr followed by the filename
and the output will be on the screen::
    $ capitalizr inputfile.txt

Pipe input to it::

    $ cat inputfile.txt | capitalizr -

Input from **stdin**::

    $ capitalizr -
    the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
    ^D
    the Quick Brown fox Jumps Over the Lazy dog

You can write the output into file by passing ``-o`` followed by output filename,
and the output will be on a file named outputfile.txt::

    $ capitalizr inputfile.txt -o outputfile.txt

Override the default length of words to be escaped. The default it 3::

    $ capitalizr -t 1 inputfile.txt
